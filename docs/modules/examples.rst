==================
Examples
==================
The library contains several examples to get the users familiar with the syntax and capabilities of the
library. At the moment, the available examples are for using the two state-of-the-art forecasting models: the :ref:`LEAR` and the :ref:`DNN` models.

For each of the models, there is a simplified example to perform daily recalibration and forecasting,
and a more complex, yet flexible, example to perform the same thing. For the DNN, there is also an example
for hyperparameter optimization.
